/*
There are several things to note about this new syntax:

1) The switch expression returns a value, which we assign directly to the dayOfWeek variable.
2) We use an arrow (->) instead of a colon (:).
3) Thereâ€™s no need for the break keyword, reducing verbosity and the potential for fall-through bugs.
4) The switch expression requires a default branch to ensure it always returns a value, thereby encouraging safer coding practices.

Yield Keyword
The new switch expressions also introduce the yield keyword.
This keyword is used when the logic of a case isn't a simple one-liner.
In such a scenario, we can't use the arrow syntax.
Instead, we switch back to using the colon and wrap our code block within braces,
but instead of break, we use yield to return the value.
