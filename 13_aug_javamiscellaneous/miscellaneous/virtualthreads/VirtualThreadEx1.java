Virtual Threads in Java

In Java, Virtual threads are now supported by the Java Platform.
Virtual threads are lightweight threads that greatly minimize the effort required to
create, operate, and manage high volumes systems that are concurrent.
As a result, they are more efficient and scalable than standard platform threads.

A thread is the smallest processing unit that can be scheduled.
It operates concurrently with, and mostly independently of other units of this type.
Itâ€™s an instance of java.lang.Thread.

There are two kinds of threads, platform threads and virtual threads:
