Logger levels:


trace
debug
info
Warn
Error


by default -> info mode is on in all packages and classes:- so by default all info,warn,error,fatal messages
will be visible, as warn,error,fatal are more severe than info level.
so logger.info,logger.warn,logger.error by default visible
but logger.debug() and logger.trace() - will not be visible for info level. As debug level is less severe than info level.


if you explicitly set : logging.level.fullpackagename:DEBUG in application properties then
only for classes in these packages, it will show all messages of debug level and more servere level i.e. info,warn,error,fatal
debug level is on: show all debug level msgs as well as info and above/more severe i.e. warn,error etc.
